# Web_Scrapper
 Toronto Stock Exchange Data Scraper: This project scrapes stock data from the Toronto Stock Exchange using Python. It extracts key information such as  company names, Revenue, market capitalization, and prices from the website Stock Analysis. 
In this project, I built a web scraper using Python to gather stock data from the Toronto Stock Exchange. Using the Requests library, I fetched the HTML content of the webpage, and then I utilized Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML structure.

I specifically targeted the stock table by finding all the relevant rows using their CSS class, it was a great way to learn about HTML structure and how to turn raw web data into meaningful insights!
